# Core Concepts

Understanding these fundamental concepts will help you make the most of OracleX. This guide covers the essential principles that power our prediction market platform.

##  Prediction Markets

### What is a Prediction Market?

A prediction market is a **trading platform where people buy and sell shares** based on the outcome of future events. Think of it as a "stock market for predictions."

**Key Features:**
-  **Market-driven odds**: Prices reflect collective belief
-  **Financial incentives**: Accurate predictors earn money
-  **Wisdom of crowds**: Aggregates diverse opinions
-  **Real-time updates**: Odds change as new information emerges

### How Prediction Markets Work

```
1. Market Creation
   
2. Users Stake on Outcomes
   
3. Market Closes at Deadline
   
4. Oracle Determines Winner
   
5. Winners Claim Rewards
```

### Example

**Market**: "Will Bitcoin reach $100,000 by Dec 31, 2025?"

- **Outcomes**: Yes / No
- **Your Stake**: 100 ORX on "Yes"
- **Current Odds**: 60% Yes, 40% No
- **Total Pool**: 10,000 ORX
- **Your Share**: 100 / 6,000 = 1.67% of Yes pool

**If Yes Wins:**
```
Your Payout = (Total Pool / Yes Pool)  Your Stake
            = (10,000 / 6,000)  100
            = 166.67 ORX
Profit = 166.67 - 100 = 66.67 ORX (66.7% ROI!)
```

##  TruthMesh AI Oracle

### What is an Oracle?

An **oracle** is a system that provides real-world data to blockchain smart contracts. Traditional oracles are:
-  Centralized (single point of failure)
-  Manual (humans decide outcomes)
-  Slow (requires multiple confirmations)
-  Expensive (high verification costs)

### TruthMesh Solution

OracleX's **TruthMesh** is a decentralized, AI-powered oracle system:

```

      TruthMesh Multi-Agent AI       

                                     
           
    Data    Validator     
   Fetcher         Agent       
           
                                  
                                  
           
   Arbiter  Confidence    
    Agent          Scorer      
           
                                   
                                   
                       
    Final                        
   Decision                      
                       

```

### Agent Roles

#### 1. Data Fetcher Agent
**Purpose**: Retrieves information from multiple sources

**Sources**:
-  APIs (CoinGecko, NewsAPI, Weather APIs)
-  News aggregators
-  Social media (Twitter sentiment)
-  Financial databases
-  Government data

**Process**:
```python
async def fetch_bitcoin_price():
    sources = [
        fetch_coingecko(),
        fetch_coinmarketcap(),
        fetch_binance(),
        fetch_kraken()
    ]
    prices = await gather_all(sources)
    return aggregate_median(prices)
```

#### 2. Validator Agent
**Purpose**: Cross-validates data accuracy

**Checks**:
-  Source reliability (historical accuracy)
-  Data consistency (cross-source matching)
-  Timestamp verification
-  Outlier detection
-  Manipulation detection

#### 3. Arbiter Agent
**Purpose**: Resolves edge cases and disputes

**Handles**:
-  Ambiguous outcomes
-  Disputed resolutions
-  Missing data
-  Statistical anomalies

#### 4. Confidence Scorer
**Purpose**: Assigns reliability scores

**Metrics**:
-  Data source quality: 0-100%
-  Cross-validation matches: 0-100%
-  Data freshness: 0-100%
-  Historical accuracy: 0-100%

**Final Score**:
```
Confidence = (0.3  Source Quality) +
             (0.3  Cross-Validation) +
             (0.2  Freshness) +
             (0.2  Historical Accuracy)
```

### DAO Structure

OracleX is governed by **ORX token holders** through decentralized voting:

```

        Governance DAO                

                                     
   Token Holders                   
                                    
   Create Proposals                
                                    
    Community Votes                
                                    
    Quorum Check                   
                                    
   Execute Changes                 
                                     

```

### Proposal Types

#### 1. Parameter Changes

### Voting Power

```
Voting Power = Staked ORX  Time Multiplier

Time Multiplier:
- 30 days:  1.0x
- 90 days:  1.2x
- 180 days: 1.5x
- 365 days: 2.0x
```

**Example**:
```
Alice stakes 1,000 ORX for 365 days
Voting Power = 1,000  2.0 = 2,000 votes

Bob stakes 1,500 ORX for 30 days
Voting Power = 1,500  1.0 = 1,500 votes

Alice has more influence despite less tokens!
```

### Quorum Requirements

| Proposal Type | Quorum | Approval |
|--------------|--------|----------|
| Parameter Change | 30% | 66% |
| Feature Addition | 30% | 60% |
| Treasury < $100K | 30% | 60% |
| Treasury > $100K | 40% | 75% |
| Emergency Action | 50% | 80% |

##  Market Economics

### How Odds Work

Markets use **automated market makers (AMM)** to calculate odds:

**Formula**: Constant Product Market Maker
```
x  y = k (constant)

Where:
x = Yes tokens in pool
y = No tokens in pool
k = constant product
```

**Example**:
```
Initial: 1,000 Yes  1,000 No = 1,000,000

User buys 100 Yes:
- Takes 100 Yes from pool
- Adds Y No to maintain k

(1,000 - 100)  (1,000 + Y) = 1,000,000
900  (1,000 + Y) = 1,000,000
1,000 + Y = 1,111.11
Y = 111.11

User pays: 111.11 ORX
Gets: 100 Yes shares
Price per share: 1.11 ORX
```

### Fee Structure

#### Trading Fees
- **Market Creation**: 0.01 BNB
- **Trading**: 0% (no trading fee!)
- **Resolution**: 2% of winning pool

#### Fee Distribution
```
100% of fees collected
    
 40%  Stakers (APY rewards)

```
