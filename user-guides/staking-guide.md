# Staking Guide

Learn how to stake ORX tokens and earn passive rewards on OracleX.

##  What is Staking?

Staking allows you to lock up ORX tokens for a fixed period to earn rewards. The longer you lock, the higher your Annual Percentage Yield (APY).

**Benefits:**
-  Earn passive income (5-72% APY)
-  Increased voting power in governance
-  Build reputation and unlock achievements
-  Contribute to platform security

**Requirements:**
- Minimum: 100 ORX tokens
- Wallet with BNB for gas fees
- Choose lock period: 30, 90, 180, or 365 days

##  Staking Pools

### Available Lock Periods

| Lock Period | Base APY | Multiplier | Effective APY | Min Stake |
|-------------|----------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| **30 days** | 5% | 1.0x | **5%** | 100 ORX |
| **90 days** | 12% | 1.2x | **14.4%** | 100 ORX |
| **180 days** | 25% | 1.5x | **37.5%** | 100 ORX |
| **365 days** | 40% | 1.8x | **72%** | 100 ORX |

### APY Breakdown

The effective APY includes:
1. **Base Rewards**: Fixed rate for lock period
2. **Time Multiplier**: Bonus for longer locks
3. **Volume Bonus**: Extra rewards from platform fees

```typescript
// APY Calculation Example
const calculateAPY = (baseAPY: number, lockDays: number) => {
  // Get multiplier based on lock period
  const multipliers = {
    30: 1.0,
    90: 1.2,
    180: 1.5,
    365: 1.8
  };
  
  const multiplier = multipliers[lockDays] || 1.0;
  const effectiveAPY = baseAPY * multiplier;
  
  return effectiveAPY;
};

// Example: 90-day lock
const baseAPY = 0.12; // 12%
const multiplier = 1.2;
const effectiveAPY = 0.12 * 1.2; // 14.4%
```

##  How Much Can You Earn?

### Reward Calculations

```typescript
// Simple reward formula
Reward = (Staked Amount  APY  Lock Period) / 365 days

// Examples:

// 30-day stake
Amount: 1,000 ORX
APY: 5%
Period: 30 days
Reward: (1000  0.05  30) / 365 = 4.11 ORX

// 90-day stake
Amount: 5,000 ORX
APY: 14.4%
Period: 90 days
Reward: (5000  0.144  90) / 365 = 177.53 ORX

// 180-day stake
Amount: 10,000 ORX
APY: 37.5%
Period: 180 days
Reward: (10000  0.375  180) / 365 = 1,849.32 ORX

// 365-day stake
Amount: 20,000 ORX
APY: 72%
Period: 365 days
Reward: 20000  0.72 = 14,400 ORX
```

### ROI Examples

| Stake Amount | Lock Period | APY | Rewards | Total Return | ROI |
|--------------|-------------|-----|---------|--------------|-----|
| 1,000 ORX | 30 days | 5% | 4 ORX | 1,004 ORX | 0.4% |
| 5,000 ORX | 90 days | 14.4% | 178 ORX | 5,178 ORX | 3.6% |
| 10,000 ORX | 180 days | 37.5% | 1,849 ORX | 11,849 ORX | 18.5% |
| 20,000 ORX | 365 days | 72% | 14,400 ORX | 34,400 ORX | 72% |
