## 📝 Market Creation Process

### Step 1: Navigate to Create Market

1. Go to **Markets** page
2. Click **"Create Market"** button (top right)
3. Or visit: https://oraclex.com/markets/create

### Step 2: Define Your Question

#### Writing Good Questions

**✅ Good Questions:**
```
"Will Bitcoin reach $100,000 before January 1, 2026?"
- Clear outcome criteria
- Specific timeframe
- Verifiable result

"Will Team A defeat Team B in the Championship Final?"
- Binary outcome
- Specific event
- Known resolution date

"Will the Fed raise interest rates in Q4 2025?"
- Definite yes/no
- Time-bound
- Public information source
```

**❌ Bad Questions:**
```
"Will Bitcoin do well?"
- Vague outcome
- No timeframe
- Subjective

"Is AI dangerous?"
- Opinion-based
- No clear resolution
- Subjective

"Who is the best player?"
- Subjective
- No criteria
- No source
```

#### Question Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**
   - Use exact dates and times
   - Define clear thresholds
   - Specify all conditions

2. **Be Objective**
   - Avoid subjective terms
   - Use measurable criteria
   - Stick to facts

3. **Be Time-Bound**
   - Set clear end date
   - Allow reasonable time for resolution
   - Consider time zones

4. **Be Unambiguous**
   - One interpretation only
   - Define edge cases
   - Clear success criteria

### Step 3: Select Category

Choose the most relevant category:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| 🏈 **Sports** | Game outcomes, championships, player stats |
| 🏛️ **Politics** | Elections, policy changes, government decisions |
| 💰 **Crypto** | Price predictions, protocol launches, adoption |
| 🎬 **Entertainment** | Award shows, box office, streaming releases |
| 🌍 **World Events** | International relations, climate, major events |
| 🔬 **Science & Tech** | Product launches, scientific discoveries, innovation |

### Step 4: Set Resolution Source

Define how the outcome will be determined.

#### Types of Sources

**1. Price Oracles**
```typescript
Source: "CoinGecko API"
Criteria: "Bitcoin USD price at 00:00 UTC on Jan 1, 2026"
URL: "https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin"
```

**2. Official Announcements**
```typescript
Source: "Federal Reserve Official Website"
Criteria: "Interest rate decision announced in FOMC statement"
URL: "https://www.federalreserve.gov"
```

**3. Sports Results**
```typescript
Source: "ESPN Official Scores"
Criteria: "Final score at end of regulation play"
URL: "https://www.espn.com"
```

**4. News Aggregators**
```typescript
Source: "Reuters"
Criteria: "Official confirmation published by Reuters"
URL: "https://www.reuters.com"
```

**5. Blockchain Data**

- Easy to understand

```typescript
Question: "Will Bitcoin reach $100k in 2025?"
Outcomes:
- YES: Bitcoin hits $100,000 or more
- NO: Bitcoin stays below $100,000
```

#### Multiple Choice Markets

For questions with multiple possible outcomes:

```typescript
Question: "Which team will win the World Cup?"
Outcomes:
- Team A
- Team B
- Team C
- Team D
- Other

(Maximum 6 outcomes)
```

**Requirements:**
- Mutually exclusive outcomes
- Collectively exhaustive (cover all possibilities)
- Clear definitions for each
- Consider "Other" option if needed

### Step 7: Add Description (Optional)

Provide additional context:

```markdown
