- **Creator**: Who created the market
- **Resolution Source**: How outcome is determined
- **Time Remaining**: Countdown to close

#### Current Odds

```typescript
// Odds display example
YES: 65% (10,500 ORX staked)

```

**Understanding Odds:**
- Higher % = More people think this outcome will happen
- Lower % = Better potential returns if you're right
- Odds change as people stake

#### Potential Returns Calculator

Enter your stake to see potential winnings:

```typescript
Your Stake: 1,000 ORX
Predicted: YES
Current YES odds: 65%
Current NO pool: 5,500 ORX

If YES wins:
Your Share: 1,000 / 11,500 = 8.7%
Winning Pool: 5,500  0.98 = 5,390 ORX (after 2% fee)
Your Reward: 5,390  8.7% = 469 ORX
Total Return: 1,000 + 469 = 1,469 ORX
Profit: +469 ORX (+46.9%)

##  Making Your First Prediction

### Step 1: Choose Your Outcome

1. Read the market question carefully
2. Review AI analysis
3. Check current odds
4. Select your predicted outcome (YES/NO or multiple choice)

### Step 2: Enter Stake Amount

```typescript
// Minimum stake

Medium: 100-1,000 ORX (serious prediction)
Large: 1,000-10,000 ORX (high confidence)
Whale: 10,000+ ORX (market maker)
```

### Step 3: Review Transaction

-  Sufficient BNB for gas

### Step 4: Approve & Stake

3. Sign approval transaction

##  Prediction Strategies

### 1. Contrarian Betting

Bet against the crowd when odds are skewed:

```typescript
// Example
Market: "Bitcoin above $100k by end of year?"
YES: 85% (42,500 ORX)
NO: 15% (7,500 ORX)

Strategy: Bet NO if you think it's overvalued
Risk: High (going against majority)
Reward: High (7,500 / 42,500 = 17.6% share if right)
```

### 2. Early Bird

Stake early before odds settle:

**Benefits:**
- Better odds before information spreads
- Influence market sentiment
- Potential for better returns

**Risks:**
- Less information available
- Market may move against you
- Could get better odds later

### 3. Follow the AI

Trust TruthMesh AI's analysis:

```typescript
If AI confidence > 80%: Consider following
If AI confidence 60-80%: Do your own research
If AI confidence < 60%: High uncertainty, be careful
```

### 4. Diversification

Spread risk across multiple markets:

```typescript
// Portfolio example
Total: 10,000 ORX

Market 1 (Sports): 2,000 ORX
Market 2 (Crypto): 2,000 ORX
Market 3 (Politics): 2,000 ORX
Market 4 (Entertainment): 2,000 ORX
Market 5 (Tech): 2,000 ORX

Risk: Distributed
Potential: Steady returns from multiple markets
```

### 5. Time-Based Strategy

**Early Resolution Markets:**
- Resolve in 24-48 hours
- Quick results
- Lower stakes typically

**Long-Term Markets:**
- Weeks or months to resolve
- More time for research
- Larger stakes

### 6. High-Volume Markets

Bet on popular markets:

**Advantages:**
- More liquidity
- Easier to understand
- Better odds stability

**Disadvantages:**
