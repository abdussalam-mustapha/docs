# Governance Guide

Learn how to participate in OracleX governance and shape the future of the platform.

## 🏛️ What is Governance?

OracleX uses a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) model where ORX token holders vote on protocol decisions.

**You can vote on:**
- Protocol parameter changes
- Treasury spending
- Feature additions
- Smart contract upgrades
- Community initiatives
- Dispute resolutions

**Power to the people** - No single entity controls OracleX!

## 🗳️ Voting Power

### How Voting Power Works

```typescript
Voting Power = ORX Balance × Staking Multiplier

Examples:
1,000 ORX (not staked) = 1,000 votes
1,000 ORX (30-day stake) = 1,083 votes (+8.3%)
1,000 ORX (90-day stake) = 1,333 votes (+33.3%)
1,000 ORX (180-day stake) = 1,667 votes (+66.7%)
1,000 ORX (365-day stake) = 2,000 votes (+100%)
```

**Benefits of Staking:**
- More voting power
- Higher influence
- Governance rewards
- Priority proposals

### Checking Your Voting Power

```typescript
Go to: Governance Dashboard

Your Voting Power
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
ORX Balance: 5,000 ORX
Staked: 3,000 ORX (180 days)
Liquid: 2,000 ORX

Voting Power Breakdown:
Liquid: 2,000 votes
Staked: 3,000 × 1.667 = 5,001 votes
Total: 7,001 votes

Your Rank: #245 / 12,000 voters
Percentile: Top 2%

# Proposal: Reduce Trading Fees

## Summary
Reduce platform trading fees from 2% to 1.5% to increase competitiveness
and user adoption.

## Motivation
- Competitors charge 1-1.5% fees

- Increased volume = more revenue overall
- Better user experience

## Specification

- Proposed fee: 1.5% (150 basis points)
- Implementation: Update MarketFactory.sol parameter
- Timeline: Effective immediately after execution

## Expected Impact
- Volume increase: +40% (estimated)
- Revenue impact: +5% (40% volume × 75% fee)
- User growth: +20% (more competitive pricing)

## Risks
- Short-term revenue decrease possible
- May need to adjust if volume doesn't increase
- Requires smart contract update

## Implementation Steps
1. DAO approves proposal
2. 48-hour timelock
3. Update contract parameter
4. Monitor impact for 30 days
5. Reassess if needed

## Budget
No direct costs. Potential revenue impact in transition period.
